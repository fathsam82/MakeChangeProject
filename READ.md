# Make changeProject
The overall idea for this project was to make a simple cash register application that was based off of the item Price and the amount tendered for that item.

## Overview
description of project
There were three main routes of this project. The first condition considered if the customer provided exact change for an item. It simply output a thankyou statement to the customer and to have a nice day. The second condition, if the customer paid with an amount that required change to be given back, was where I called on a separate method called changeMaker. This is were the bulk of the coding took place. I stored the amount of each denominations needed to give back to the customer in a variable called twentyCounter, tenCount, etc. With each if block within the called method, I updated remainder and declared that amount as tendered, and repeated the process. In the third main condition, if the required item price was not met with the money tendered from the customer, they get an error message.

## Technologies Used
-Java
-Eclipse

## Lessons Learned
I reinforced my understanding of calling on methods and casting variables.
